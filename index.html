<!-- ABSTRACT -->
<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p class="ex1">
The rise of sophisticated cyber-attacks has increased reliance on Security Operations Centres (SOCs)
as the frontline of organisational defence. This paper examines the role of SOC analysts in detecting 
and preventing cyber threats by combining automated systems with human expertise. Drawing on 
recent studies, it highlights challenges such as alert fatigue, false positives, increasing system 
complexity, and the expanding responsibilities of human analysts. The research also evaluates how 
emerging technologies, including machine learning and large language models, influence modern SOC 
operations. The study concludes that effective cyber defence is achieved through balancing automation, 
situational awareness, experience, and collaborative problem-solving among analysts.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p class="ex1">
As organisations continue to expand their digital infrastructure, cybersecurity has emerged as one of 
the defining challenges of the modern era. Security Operations Centres serve as mission control for 
cyber defence, where analysts continuously monitor, detect, and respond to threats in real time. SOCs 
provide critical defensive capabilities by correlating logs, identifying anomalies, and investigating alerts 
generated from a variety of security tools. Analysts play a crucial role in interpreting incomplete 
information, prioritising incidents, and ensuring operational resilience.
<br><br>
Automation and human judgement work closely together. While security tools generate alerts, analysts 
must validate severity, assess risk, and decide on an appropriate response. SOC effectiveness depends 
not only on technology but also on disciplined procedures, communication, and analytical ability.

<!-- ANALYSIS -->
<h3 id="Analysis">Analysis and discussion</h3>
<p class="ex1">
Security Operations Centres rely on the combined strength of people, processes, and technology. 
Analysts are typically structured into tiered roles where Tier 1 personnel triage alerts, Tier 2 analysts 
conduct deeper investigation, and senior analysts perform threat hunting and coordinate incident 
response. This structure enables efficient allocation of workload during high-pressure events.
<br><br>
Modern SOCs collect and correlate data from firewalls, intrusion detection systems, cloud logs, 
endpoints, identity systems, and network activity. However, a major challenge is the high volume of 
false positives produced by SIEM platforms. Research shows that excessive false alarms contribute 
heavily to analyst fatigue and reduce long-term effectiveness. This creates a need for improved alert 
filtering, triage methods, and integration of high-quality threat intelligence.
<br><br>
Emerging technologies aim to reduce the workload on analysts. Machine learning techniques can group 
similar alerts, prioritise high-risk patterns, and detect behavioural anomalies. Real-time learning models 
have demonstrated success in identifying suspicious activity more accurately than traditional signature-
based systems. However, research highlights that machine learning cannot entirely replace human 
oversight. Analysts provide essential contextual understanding, risk assessment, and decision-making.
<br><br>
Analyst bias is another emerging challenge. Individuals often rely heavily on tools they personally trust, 
which can affect judgement during investigations. Collaboration, training, and shared documentation 
are crucial to maintaining balanced decision-making. Strong governance frameworks and knowledge-
sharing practices significantly improve SOC performance, especially during crisis situations.
<br><br>
Threat hunting has also become a core SOC responsibility. Instead of waiting for alerts, analysts 
proactively search for suspicious patterns, leveraging threat intelligence, behavioural analysis, and past 
incident data. This process improves detection of advanced persistent threats that do not trigger typical 
alarms.
<br><br>
Automation is increasingly used to handle repetitive tasks such as isolating compromised hosts, 
corralling suspicious traffic, or blocking malicious IP addresses. Large language models are being 
introduced to summarise incidents and assist analysts with report generation. While these tools improve 
efficiency, human validation remains essential to maintain accuracy.
<br><br>
Overall, current research shows that SOC analysts remain the cognitive centre of cyber defence. 
Despite growing automation, organisational security continues to depend on human expertise, 
experience, intuition, and problem-solving ability.
