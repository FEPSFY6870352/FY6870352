<!-- ABSTRACT -->
<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p class="ex1">
The rise of sophisticated cyber-attacks has increased reliance on Security Operations Centres (SOCs)
as the frontline of organisational defence. This paper examines the role of SOC analysts in detecting 
and preventing cyber threats through a combination of automated systems and human expertise. 
Challenges such as alert fatigue, false positives, and expanding system complexity are explored, 
alongside the influence of machine learning and large language models on SOC performance. 
The findings highlight that effective cyber defence relies on balancing automation with the experience, 
judgement, and situational awareness of analysts.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p class="ex1">
As organisations expand their digital infrastructure, cybersecurity has become one of the defining 
challenges of the modern era. Security Operations Centres act as the command hub for cyber defence, 
where teams of analysts continuously monitor, detect, and respond to threats. SOC analysts interpret 
alerts, correlate logs, evaluate anomalies, and make rapid decisions that directly impact organisational 
security.
<br><br>
While automated systems generate alerts, human analysts assess severity, confirm malicious intent, 
and determine the correct response. This combination of technological capability and human analysis 
forms the backbone of modern cyber defence. Effective SOC operations rely on communication, 
process discipline, and continual learning.

<!-- ANALYSIS -->
<h3 id="Analysis">Analysis and discussion</h3>
<p class="ex1">
SOCs depend on a layered structure of people, processes, and technology. Analysts are typically 
organised into tiers: Tier 1 handles triage, Tier 2 investigates complex incidents, and Tier 3 conducts 
threat hunting and long-term strategic analysis. This system ensures efficiency during high-volume 
events.
<br><br>
SOCs collect data from multiple sources: firewalls, endpoint systems, cloud logs, intrusion detection 
systems, and identity providers. However, the overwhelming number of false positives generated by 
SIEM tools contributes to alert fatigue. This has pushed organisations to adopt smarter filtering 
approaches and integrate threat intelligence feeds to improve triage accuracy.
<br><br>
Machine learning systems offer opportunities to reduce analyst workload. They can detect behavioural 
anomalies, cluster similar alerts, and identify high-risk events. Despite technological progress, research 
shows that algorithmic models cannot fully replace human expertise. Analysts provide contextual 
knowledge, creative problem-solving, and risk-based decision-making.
<br><br>
Analyst bias presents another operational challenge. Personal familiarity with certain tools may cause 
over-reliance on them, affecting judgement. Collaborative environments supported by clear governance 
and documentation help mitigate this issue. Additionally, strong knowledge-sharing practices build 
team resilience.
<br><br>
Threat hunting is a proactive SOC activity where analysts actively search for hidden or emerging 
threats. This includes analysing unusual user behaviour, scanning for lateral movement, and reviewing 
historical logs for patterns that automated systems may overlook.
<br><br>
Automation—especially through SOAR tools—now supports SOCs by handling repetitive tasks such as 
IP blocking, host isolation, and automated ticket creation. Large language models have also emerged as 
support tools, helping analysts summarise incidents and produce reports. However, these systems still 
require human oversight to maintain accuracy and prevent misinterpretation.
<br><br>
Overall, research concludes that SOC analysts remain the intellectual centre of cyber defence. Despite 
increasing automation, the effectiveness of a SOC ultimately depends on human judgement, 
experience, and coordination.
