<!-- ABSTRACT -->
<h3 id="Abstract">Abstract</h3>
<p class="ex1">
The rise of sophisticated cyber-attacks has increased reliance on Security Operations 
Centres (SOCs) as the frontline of organisational defence. This paper examines the role of 
SOC analysts in detecting and preventing cyber threats by combining automated systems 
with human expertise. Drawing on recent studies, it highlights challenges such as alert 
fatigue, false positives, increasing system complexity, and the expanding responsibilities 
of human analysts. The research also evaluates how emerging technologies, including 
machine learning and large language models, influence modern SOC operations. The study 
concludes that effective cyber defence is achieved through the balance of automation, 
situational awareness, experience, and collaborative problem-solving among analysts.

<!-- INTRODUCTION -->
<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p class="ex1">
As organisations continue to expand their digital infrastructure, cybersecurity has emerged 
as one of the defining challenges of the modern era. Security Operations Centres serve as 
mission control for cyber defence, where analysts continuously monitor, detect, and 
respond to threats in real time. According to Aslan et al. (2022):contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, SOCs provide 
critical defensive capabilities by correlating logs, identifying anomalies, and investigating 
alerts generated from a variety of security tools. Analysts play a crucial role in interpreting 
incomplete information, prioritising incidents, and ensuring operational resilience.

Within a SOC, automation and human judgement work together. While tools such as 
intrusion detection systems and SIEMs generate alerts, analysts must validate their 
accuracy, determine the severity of incidents, and decide whether a real threat exists. 
SOC effectiveness depends not only on technology but on disciplined procedures, 
communication, and the analytical abilities of its personnel.

<!-- ANALYSIS -->
<h3 id="Analysis">Analysis and discussion</h3>
<p class="ex1">

Security Operations Centres rely on the combined strength of people, processes, and 
technology. Analysts are typically organised into tiered structures where Tier 1 personnel 
triage alerts, Tier 2 analysts investigate incidents, and senior analysts perform threat 
hunting and coordinate responses. Conn (2022):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1} compares SOC operations to 
“war rooms” where fast decision-making and collaboration determine success during 
critical incidents.

Modern SOCs are built around continuous data collection. Logs from firewalls, intrusion 
detection systems, endpoints, and cloud environments feed into SIEM platforms for 
correlation. However, Alahmadi, Axon and Martinovic (2022):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2} discovered that up 
to 99% of SIEM alarms are false positives—an issue that contributes heavily to analyst 
fatigue. This creates a need for improved filtering, triage strategies, and threat intelligence 
integration.

Machine learning methods offer potential improvements. Shaik et al. (2022):contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3} 
showed that datasets such as NSL-KDD can significantly enhance intrusion detection 
accuracy. Yang et al. (2021):contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4} developed ASSERT, a near real-time learning 
model capable of identifying attack behaviours dynamically. Despite technological advances, 
Forsberg et al. (2023):contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5} note that MTTD and MTTR alone cannot measure 
decision-making quality, emphasising the human role within SOC processes.

Bias is also a challenge. Analysts often rely more heavily on tools they trust, creating 
“trust hierarchies” that may prevent the adoption of better methods (Alahmadi et al., 
2022):contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}. Collaboration and training can reduce this effect. Majid et al. (2021):contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7} 
highlight that SOCs supported by strong governance and knowledge-sharing perform more 
effectively in crisis situations.

Threat hunting is another essential component. Analysts proactively search for unknown 
threats, guided by behavioural patterns and previous incidents. Patterson et al. (2023):contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8} 
observe that insufficient documentation of lessons learned reduces long-term defensive 
effectiveness.

AI-driven automation is expanding within SOCs. SOAR systems streamline repetitive tasks 
like isolating compromised hosts or blocking malicious IPs. Singh et al. (2025):contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9} 
found that large language models support analysts by summarising incidents and generating 
reports, though human validation remains essential to prevent errors. Automation enhances 
efficiency but cannot replace the contextual awareness, intuition, and judgement of skilled 
analysts.

<p class="ex1">
Overall, the literature demonstrates that SOC analysts remain the cognitive core of cyber 
defence. Despite advances in automation, organisational security depends on human 
expertise, experience, intuition, and communication. Analysts act as the bridge between 
technology and strategic response—interpreting ambiguous data, coordinating with 
stakeholders, and strengthening security posture through continuous improvement.
