<p>
The increasing sophistication, frequency, and scale of cyber-attacks have positioned Security Operations
Centres (SOCs) as a critical component of organisational cyber defence. This article examines the role of
SOC analysts in the detection and prevention of cyber attacks, focusing on how their work combines
automated monitoring tools with human judgement and decision-making. Drawing on recent research,
the discussion highlights key challenges such as alert fatigue, high rates of false positives, complex hybrid
infrastructures, and a shortage of experienced analysts. It then explores how analysts use Security
Information and Event Management (SIEM) platforms, Security Orchestration, Automation and Response
(SOAR) tools, and threat intelligence to triage, investigate, and remediate security incidents. The article
argues that although automation and machine learning can significantly reduce workload and improve
consistency, they cannot fully replace human understanding of context, risk, and business impact. The
conclusion emphasises that effective cyber defence relies on a partnership between capable analysts,
well-designed processes, and carefully tuned technical controls rather than on technology alone.
</p>

<h3 id="Introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>
Over the past decade, organisations have become increasingly dependent on digital infrastructure. Cloud
services, remote work, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and software-as-a-service platforms have expanded
the potential attack surface far beyond the traditional on-premises network. At the same time, cyber
threats have grown more organised and more financially motivated. Ransomware, data-theft campaigns,
and supply-chain compromises routinely make headlines, with impacts ranging from service disruption to
long-term reputation damage.
</p>
<p>
In this landscape, the Security Operations Centre provides centralised monitoring and response. A SOC is
usually staffed by analysts working in shifts to provide near-continuous coverage of an organisation’s
systems, networks, and applications. Their primary objective is to identify suspicious events as early as
possible, determine whether they are malicious, and coordinate an appropriate response. Analysts rely on
a range of tools, including SIEM platforms that aggregate logs from different sources, endpoint detection
solutions, intrusion-detection systems, and threat-intelligence feeds. However, tools alone are not enough.
They generate large volumes of alerts, many of which are repetitive or low-risk, and they struggle to
understand business context.
</p>
<p>
The literature consistently describes SOC work as a socio-technical activity in which people, processes,
and technology interact. Tiered structures are commonly used. Tier&nbsp;1 analysts handle initial triage,
acknowledge alerts, and carry out straightforward investigations. Tier&nbsp;2 analysts perform more detailed
analysis, correlate multiple data sources, and decide whether to escalate incidents. Tier&nbsp;3 staff focus on
advanced threat hunting, malware analysis, and cross-incident pattern recognition. This structure supports
specialisation but can also introduce communication challenges if information does not flow smoothly
between tiers.
</p>
<p>
Understanding the day-to-day responsibilities of SOC analysts is therefore essential for improving cyber
defence. By examining their role in detection, investigation, and prevention, this article links theoretical
research on SOC performance with practical operational realities. It also reflects on the extent to which
emerging technologies such as machine learning and large language models can genuinely support
analysts rather than simply adding another layer of complexity.
</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="Analysis">Analysis and Discussion</h3>
<p>
The first aspect of the SOC analyst’s role is <b>detection</b>. SIEM platforms collect logs from firewalls, endpoints,
servers, cloud services, authentication systems, and business applications. Correlation rules and use cases
generate alerts when specific conditions are met, such as multiple failed logins followed by a successful
one from a new device, or large volumes of data leaving a sensitive server. However, these rules are only as
effective as their configuration. If they are too strict, they generate excessive false positives; if they are too
permissive, important signals may be missed. Analysts therefore spend considerable time tuning rules,
reviewing which alerts are genuinely useful, and providing feedback to improve detection logic.
</p>
<p>
A major challenge identified by several studies is <b>alert fatigue</b>. Modern SOCs can receive thousands of
alerts per day. Many are noisy or repetitive, particularly when misconfigured systems or vulnerability scans
are present on the network. Constant exposure to low-quality alerts can reduce concentration and lead to
critical events being overlooked. To address this, analysts often categorise alerts into playbooks that define
standard triage steps, enrichment queries, and recommended actions. SOAR platforms can automate parts
of this workflow, for example by automatically checking an IP address against threat-intelligence feeds,
gathering host information, or temporarily isolating a machine from the network. Automation reduces
manual effort, but analysts still need to review actions, confirm findings, and adapt playbooks when attack
techniques change.
</p>
<p>
Once an alert is confirmed as potentially malicious, the focus shifts to <b>investigation</b>. Analysts pivot between
data sources: endpoint telemetry, network captures, authentication logs, cloud audit trails, and application
logs. The goal is to reconstruct the attacker’s path — often described using the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework —
and to understand how far the compromise has spread. Effective investigation depends on both technical
skills (for example, interpreting PowerShell command-lines or Windows Event IDs) and softer skills such as
hypothesis generation and critical thinking. Analysts must decide which leads are worth following and when
there is enough evidence to declare an incident.
</p>
<p>
Human factors strongly influence this stage. Research shows that analysts develop “trust hierarchies”
towards their tools. They may rely heavily on certain dashboards or detection engines that have proved
reliable in the past, while discounting others. This can be helpful for speed but also risks blind spots if a
particular data source is not consulted. Organisations therefore benefit from regular training, knowledge
sharing, and post-incident reviews where analysts discuss what went well and what could be improved.
These activities not only refine technical detections but also strengthen shared mental models of how
threats behave in their specific environment.
</p>
<p>
The final component of the role is <b>prevention and continuous improvement</b>. SOC analysts do not only react
to incidents; they also provide feedback that shapes wider security strategy. After a serious incident, they
help identify root causes such as missing patches, weak access controls, or gaps in monitoring coverage.
Lessons learned are fed into new use cases, firewall policies, identity-and-access-management changes,
and user-awareness training. Proactive threat hunting campaigns, where analysts deliberately search for
subtle indicators of compromise rather than waiting for alerts, can reveal dormant threats and mis-used
accounts that automated systems have missed.
</p>
<p>
Emerging technologies provide additional support but do not remove the need for human expertise. Machine
learning models can cluster similar alerts, highlight unusual user behaviour, or predict which events are most
likely to be high-risk. Large language models can summarise long log files, propose hypotheses, or help
junior analysts interpret unfamiliar artefacts. However, these tools can also introduce errors or biased
outputs. The analyst remains responsible for validating results, assessing business impact, and choosing
proportionate responses. In practice, the most effective SOCs are those where technology handles routine
enrichment and correlation while analysts focus on interpretation, decision-making, and communication
with stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
Overall, the literature and operational experience both suggest that SOC analysts act as the intellectual
centre of cyber defence. Their work sits at the intersection of technical detection, organisational risk
management, and incident response. As threats continue to evolve, investment in analyst training, clear
procedures, and well-tuned tooling is at least as important as purchasing new security products. A SOC
without skilled analysts quickly becomes an expensive logging platform rather than an active defence
capability.
